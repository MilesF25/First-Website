Next steo is to make the image carosuel with js

extra stuff, detail the header and carosuel bar



1. Issues with js function. When I tried to run it, it would show the first image, but when i clikced right arrow nothing happened. when i clicked the left arrow it moved but its not displaying the second image, its just displaying the word pics. Something is wrong in the js or html

solution,1 : GPT said that when i was doing the line ``let currentSrc = currentImage.src.split('/').pop(); // get just the file name`` It was getting the full path of the image, not just the file name. So when I compared it to the array of image names, it was not matching. So I changed it to ``let currentSrc = currentImage.src.split('/').pop().split('\\').pop(); // get just the file name``. But this didn't work. While this is good to have the problem is still here.

solution 2: A typo on my pat I had should of had``const rightArrow = container.querySelector('.arrow-right'); `` but I had ``.arrowright-``



2. Now im on to the experince section. So far its been good


3. Pulling my hair out. MY dropdown menu is not working on home page but it is on my other pages.
solution. ITS BECUASE OF THE CARD BOX, its blocking the dropdown

taking a break for today: issue    <section class=" hero">, instead of    <section class="hero">

NOPE

issue was becuase i had the position relative. if i remove that then the drop down works. I had to comment out parts of my 
html to get figure out what part was causing the issue
