                For my senior thesis, I originally wanted to explore quantum cryptography. My original idea was to make
                a quantum toolkit that would evaluate quantum resistant cryptography and potentially simulate quantum
                attacks. I was in over my head <img src="..\..\..\assets\doge_laugh.jpg" alt="ðŸ˜Š"
                    style="width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">. But at the same time, I was in a tough
                spot. My original idea which was going to basically be a cyber tool kit. It would have port scanning,
                malware analysis, and some other features I don't remember. Sadly this idea was shut down 2 months into
                my senior year because it wasn't feasible. Which is fair, too many hurdles and I'd need permission.

                So my next best idea is to try out quantum encryption!<img src="..\..\..\assets\doge_laugh.jpg" alt="ðŸ˜Š"
                    style="width: 1em; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> After school, I'd sit in the comp sci
                building trying to learn about quantum mechanics and quantum computing. It was hard but I kind of
                understood the idea of it. I tried to make a prototype of my quantum toolkit but I needed a quantum
                computer. So I decided to use IBM's quantum computer, I used the qiskit library and barely made a
                functioning test program. I was able to get a qubit into super position. Trying to understand qiskit was
                hard, and the information I found online was outdated. Quantum computing is still new and I just don't
                have enough knowledge to learn everything in a short amount of time.

                Still wanting to use encryption, I somehow thought about databases. I don't really remember how but I
                came up with an idea of making a personalized encrypted database. Basically, I would use a postgresql
                database and fernet encryption to locally encrypt the information inside the database. I would store the
                key using a python module called keyring. This wasn't a complex project looking back but at the time I
                was stressed. I had a lot on my plate at the time, I definitely think I could do a better job now.
