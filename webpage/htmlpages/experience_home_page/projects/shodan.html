            <br>
            <p class="cmu-text">so i was interested in learning more about network vulnerabilities and how to find them
                After writing an article about the salt typhoon hack for my internship, which at the time of wrighting
                this
                should be on my linkedin in a day or two. But basically, chinese government hackers exploited a backdoor
                the US government uses to "legally" see US citizens data and messages. Now that tons of government and
                citizens
                data is at risk, I wanted to learn more about how these vulnerabilities are found and exploited.

                I found this cool website called Shodan that lets you search for internet-connected devices and see if
                they have any known vulnerabilities.
                I wanted to write a script that could take a search query, like "apache port:80", and then use the
                Shodan API to find devices that match that query
                and check if they have any CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) associated with them.


                The making of this script is straightforward now that I completed it. But when I was trying to figure
                out what I wanted to do I was a bit clueless.
                How could I do something cool with Shodan? At first I though about making some kind of sql like query
                language for shodan, but that seemed a bit too ambitious.
                Halfway through writing that code I realized that im doing way too much. Why use my program when you
                could just go on the Shodan website and search it up there.

                Then I thought about making a script that could take a search query and return the top 5 most exploited
                CVEs, organizations, and services associated with devices that match that query.</p>
